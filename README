My game for the 24th iteration of Ludum Dare 48 - Theme is evolution!

Darn! I'm not finished! :-(
First I slipped in the Jam and then I still didn't make it. Just a few hours missing to being playable...argh, so close! I'll finish it tomorrow and upload a post-jam version.

Second Ludum Dara entry, this time from me alone. First time working with Pygame, which has been amazing!

The game: Your goal is it to recreate the evolution of the planet earth from it's early beginnings as boiling magma sphere to the evolution of life, humans and civilization.
You combine multiple Elements to unlock new ones. Just try it, it's easy!

PS: A lot of pictures are still missing, I did not have the time to create them for all elements)
